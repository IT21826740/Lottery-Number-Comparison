# Lottery-Number-Comparison

**Features:**
- Generates random lottery numbers (5 numbers between 0 and 9).
- Allows the user to input their own set of 5 numbers.
- Compares the user's numbers to the lottery numbers and counts matching entries.
- Displays the lottery numbers, user's numbers, and the count of matching entries.

**Usage:**
